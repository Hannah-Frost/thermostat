# Thermostat #

  This program uses JavaScript and Jasmine to recreate the system of a thermostat. It will be created using TDD, which involves creating tests first and gradually adding source-code to correct the errors given. Furthermore, a domain model will be created to satisfy the requirements of a thermostat. This model will be followed and altered throughout the project.

## What criteria does this program satisfy?
- Thermostat temperature starts at 20 degrees.
- Temperature can be increased and decreased with an up / down function.
- Power saving mode is on by default.
- With power saving mode, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees.
- Without power saving mode, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees.
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees.
- Temperature can be reset to 20 degrees using a reset function.
- Thermostats current energy usage can be shown (<18 : low-usage, <25 : medium-usage, higher : high-usage).
